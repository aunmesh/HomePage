# Biography

I am a Masters student, in [Computer Science and Engineering](cse.iitk.ac.in), at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](iitk.ac.in) advised by [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/). My interests are in problems of Computer Vision. I have previously done projects in the fields of 3D reconstruction, Active learning, Multi-Agent system among few other areas. I am currently interested in the field of Generative Models and their use in Computer Vision. When not found in lab I will most likely be sleeping or playing soccer. For a detail of my academic career take a look at my [CV](/files/cv.pdf).
